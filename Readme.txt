1. Run the programs in sequence (1, 2 and then 3)
2. Change the path/directory inside every program file

Program 1:
# This file will help you to generate random dataset for GDP, Urbanization and Immigration
# Task 1: Your task is to find real world data online and replace with randomly generated data
# Task 2: The plots are plotted until 2023/2204, but you need to plot for another 30 years 

Program 2:
# This program will help us to combine the population_data.csv and economic_data.csv 
# files together

Program 3:
# After combining both csv files then you can run this main program
# NOTE 1: You need to still replace random economic data with real data (if possible)
# NOTE 2: You also need to plot the data for the next 30 years (.i.e.; 2023+30years) 
# NOTE 3: Why the economic_data plots are almost equal to zero. Is it because of random data?
# Exponential Model is suppose to fit the actual data curve perfectly... Can we design this?
